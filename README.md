### 👥 Building Your Team

I'll bring in the perfect assistant with exactly the skills you need!

### 💫 Working Together

Try these magic words:

- 🤔 "Think about..." - Get insights without making changes
- 🤖� "Learn about..." - Discover capabilities and rules of any agent
- 🔍 "Review [path]" - Get a detailed analysis of any agent's setup
- 💾 "Save this" - Keep track of our progress
- 🔄 "Let's start fresh" - Begin with a clean slate

For example, try:

- "Review docs/roles/code-reviewer/ for best practices"
- "Review docs/roles/writer/ and suggest improvements"
- "Review docs/roles/task-manager/ focusing on learning capabilities"

When reviewing, I'll check:
