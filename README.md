# Agent Architecture System

A flexible and extensible agent-based system for managing AI assistants with different roles and capabilities.

## Core Components

### Agent Roles

The system supports multiple agent roles, each with:

- Defined expertise areas
- Specific responsibilities
- Memory systems
- Interaction patterns
- Learning mechanisms

### Memory System

Each agent has a structured memory system:

- Documentation: `docs/roles/{role-name}/`
- Knowledge Base: `docs/knowledge/{domain}/`
- Learning tracking mechanisms

## Available Commands

### Agent Management

- `/agent create [role-name]` - Create a new agent role
- `/agent validate [role-name]` - Validate agent configuration
- `/agent update [role-name]` - Update existing agent

### Utility Commands

- `save` - Create a git commit with descriptive message
- `think` - Analyze topic without making changes
- `restart` - Reset context and review files
- `rule: xxx` - Add new behavior rule
- `learn xxx` - Analyze learning request and determine required tools/APIs

## Best Practices

### Role Design

- Clear, focused purpose
- Non-overlapping responsibilities
- Well-defined interactions
- Structured memory system
- Learning mechanisms
- Documentation requirements

### Memory Management

- Consistent structure
- Version controlled
- Domain-specific organization
- Clear access patterns
- Learning integration

### Documentation

- Complete role specifications
- Clear usage guidelines
- Example interactions
- Integration points
- Maintenance requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-deployment Checks

- Configuration completeness
- Memory structure setup
- Documentation completeness
- Interaction patterns
- Learning mechanisms

### Ongoing Monitoring

- Performance tracking
- Learning effectiveness
- Interaction success
- Documentation updates
